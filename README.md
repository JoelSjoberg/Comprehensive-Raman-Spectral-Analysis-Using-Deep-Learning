# Comprehensive Raman Spectral Analysis Using Deep Learning
We present two deep learning models capable of simultaneous denoising and correction of Raman spectra, significantly accelerating high-quality data acquisition. Raman spectroscopy is a non-destructive analytical technique that reveals molecular vibrations, enabling precise identification of chemical compounds and material properties. Its spatial resolution and compatibility with microscopic imaging allow for high-resolution chemical mapping of heterogeneous samples. However, spectral artifacts such as baseline drift, cosmic rays, and instrumental noise complicate data interpretation, necessitating correction. Our models reduce exposure time by 90\%  while preserving signal integrity, as demonstrated on noisy spectra from brain tumor samples. These models are versatile and can be readily applied to novel Raman datasets, offering an order-of-magnitude improvement in acquisition efficiency. This work advances Raman spectroscopy as a faster, more reliable tool for chemical analysis, with broad applications in materials science, biomedical research, and beyond.
